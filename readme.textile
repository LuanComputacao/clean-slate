h1. Clean Slate HTML

h2. What is it?

*It is a basic starter HTML file*. It is intentionally light and omits everything that happens outside of HTML. It is performance-friendly, accessible, and unassuming of HTML content.

It provides only the basics so authors can add their own stuff without having to rip out any unused markup.
