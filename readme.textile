h1. Clean Slate HTML

h2. What is it?

*Clean Slate is a basic starter HTML file.* It is intentionally light and omits everything outside of HTML file. It's goal is to be performance-friendly and accessible.

Clean Slate does not assume any HTML tags and provides only the basics. Authors can add their own stuff without ripping out any unnecessary markup.
